The small boiler can hold up to 10L of water, which is heated by the firepit to create steam. The hotter the firepit, the more steam, the more power. It is recommended to use Coals for their temperature and burn time, giving a higher power output.<br><br><i>Make sure the boiler doesn't run out of water!</i>"
